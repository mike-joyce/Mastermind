README

My friend Will introduced me to Mastermind. He's unbeatable and hella fast at it, having indepdently rediscovered Donald Knuth's 6-move-worst-case-scenario algorithm. For spoilers on that and game lore, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game).

Why is everything in one file? So it's easier to e-mail to people.
